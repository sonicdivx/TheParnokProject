\poemtitle{To Khodaseyevitch}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{that sudden-pursed my mouth }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Memory of a child: these pears - \\
wrinkled, small, pinched, \\
and tucked with sour flesh \\
that sudden-pursed my mouth: just so \\
my pleasure in your poems' \\
harsh-bitter skelfs.\\!

\poemtitle{Ghazals}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{white bullbay flower -- your hand}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Comfort of pain -- your hand,\\
white bullbay flower -- your hand.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
One winter afternoon tapped on my door,\\
a sable-fur held in your hand.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Ah, butterfly on the stalk of my wrist,\\
it glimmered and stayed -- not now -- your hand!\\!
%------------------------------------------------
And your hand fired what your enemies\\
damped -- and I -- but did not put out.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
The megrim queen that fired the fiery\\ soft-sweetness in me -- your hand!\\!
%------------------------------------------------
It spurned me straight in the heart (how\\
could I complain, it is yours) -- your hand.\\!

\poemtitle{On Other Shores}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{millenia later, in just such a youthful spring, }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
So on other shores, by another singing sea,\\
millenia later, in such a youthful spring,\\
vaguely recalling her ancient Aeolian childhood,\\
a thoughtful maiden runs her fingers over the strings.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Hellas's breath flows to her as a wind from the sea;\\
the wind, unsensed by others, moves her heart:\\
the maiden feels she will complete your dreams, Sappho,\\
she'll sing the songs that have not fully sounded to us.\\!

\poemtitle{Grey Rose}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{ah, my blood starts to sing}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Night. Clotted snow drops.\\
Moscow is asleep... but I...\\
ah, I am all awake\\
my love!\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Ah, my blood starts to sing\\
in this stifling night...\\
Listen! Listen! Listen!\\
my love:\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Silver rimes\\
in your petals.\\
O, grey rose,\\
my poems -- for you!\\!
%------------------------------------------------
You breathe beneath the white,\\
Rose of December,\\
and dole to me\\
your restless joy.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
I drink and cry,\\
cry and drink,\\
and cry that I may lose you,\\
my Rose!\\!

\poemtitle{In a White Night}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Atop the nude blank whiteness}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
 It is not the sky -- this stifled dome\\
 atop the nude blank whiteness of the houses,\\
 as if some careless thing\\
 had spread a shroud on people and all things.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
And dark -- like light's shadow,\\
and light -- like dark's reflection.\\
Was it a day? Or was it night?\\
Or some disturbed half-dream?\\!
%------------------------------------------------
I look upon all this with wiser eyes,\\
and thus my peace is gentler still,\\
I look upon your mouth, stopped\\
with kisses that are not mine.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
So let it be, your lie-be-gentle, lie-unruffled\\
look beneath those lidded eyes --\\
surely, underneath this sky\\
anyone may be to blame!\\!

\poemtitle{Sapphic Strophes}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{millenia later, in just such a youthful  }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
If I catch the song of the Aeolian lyre,\\
I burst into flame, I don't walk -- I dance,\\
my voice imitates, my hand is nimble --\\
in my veins, music.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
I'm not trying the pen, I'm tuning strings,\\
occupied with an inspired concern:\\
to release into freedom, pour from my heart\\
the stringed sounds.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
I've not, as you see, in this life forgotten\\
the unforgivable joys of unforgettable songs,\\
which of old my girlfriends sang\\
in Sappho's classroom.\\!

\poemtitle{The Church Organ}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Grown tired of prayerful verses,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I remember a solemn voice,\\
An alien service and temple.\\
I'm a teenager. In the sun my hair\\
Shines like fire; my tread is stubborn.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Grown tired of prayerful glances,\\
Of the foreign, too-pious shrines,\\
I was almost gone when the choir loft\\
Thundered a whole new Latin...\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Who are you, light or wrathful angels?\\
I hadn't known paradise cried.\\
Is it from bliss they sing like that,\\
Or from an enormous longing?\\!
%------------------------------------------------
And what flash has pierced through this\\
Thunderpounding dark?\\
I close my eyes. -- This is how Isaac\\
Waited, patiently, to be slain.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
And that's when a seed of fire fell\\
Onto my soul. That's when, seized\\
By the ultimate madness, all\\
The organ's voices exploded.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
And it wasn't me who cried out --\\
This terror of bliss, this intolerable\\
Wholeness, for the first time\\
Unlocked the lips of a poet!\\!
%------------------------------------------------

\poemtitle{A Greedy Spirit}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{your self-betraying thoughts' caprice -- }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
A greedy spirit could not conquer \\
your self-betraying thoughts' caprice -- \\
and, from thousands up for hire,\\
one night was given by you to me.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
You had been tutored by dispassion\\
a brilliant artistry in love.\\
But suddenly, though used to quarry,\\
you arms, embracing me, convulsed.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Your eyes are frantic, stung by yearning,\\
your mouth is grim, clenched jealously,\\
you're paying fate back for my tardy\\
arrival by tormenting me.\\!

\poemtitle{Love's Torment}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{your self-betraying thoughts' caprice --  }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Not satiation, not desire\\
your languorousness brings to mind.\\
To all your speech and gaze are kind,\\
no one and everyone's my rival\\!
%------------------------------------------------
But to delights that are mere wishes\\
how can dreams not betray me, when \\
you say not no, not yes, but then,\\
your eyes imprint my mouth with kisses?\\!
%------------------------------------------------
O, arms affectionate and prudent,\\
how you protect your indolence...\\
But shadows under your eyes grow dense:\\
"Twill be, the hour of love's torment!"\\!

\poemtitle{Untitled (from the unpublished \textit{Juvenilia})}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{That evening was dimly smoldering -- }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
That evening was dimly smoldering -- \\
but for me it was a fiery one\\
On that evening, as you had been hankering,\\
we went out to the "Union."\\!
%------------------------------------------------
I remember your hands, weak from happiness,\\
the veins -- networks of navy blue.\\
And touching your hand was impossible,\\
both were covered in gloves by you\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Ah, again you approached so close by to me,\\
and again you turned to the side!\\
It was clear to me: words were unfindable\\
irregardless of how I tried.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
And I said: "Your eyes in the gloominess\\
are deep brown and look remote... "\\
As a waltz played we watched scenes of Switzerland --\\
in the mountains a tourist, a goat.\\!
%------------------------------------------------

Then I smiled -- you didn't respond to me ... \\
Don't we all think that we're the aggrieved!\\
And so lightly that you wouldn't notice it,\\
I caressingly smoothed your sleeve\\!

\poemtitle{Not You}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{with a doleful thought myself i comfort .       }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
And truly handsome, shapely young man, are you:\\
beneath the eyelashes' fringe two dark blue suns,\\
and curls, a darkly streaming whirlwind\\
grander than laurel, crown your soft features.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
A real Adonis, young precursor of mine!\\
You began the cup which is now passed to me --\\
pressing the lips of my beloved,\\
with a doleful thought myself I comfort:\\!
%------------------------------------------------
not you, oh young man, unbound the spell on her.\\
Marveling at the flame of her loving lips,\\
oh, first one, not yours enviously,\\
\textit{my} name shall a lover murmur, praying.\\!

\poemtitle{All of Me}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Waves do not always make easier sailing}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
All of me is twined in memories' rapture,\\
I say, as from happiness I weaken:\\
"Lesbos! Source of Lyric poetry\\
at the last of Orpheus's harbors!"\\!
%------------------------------------------------
And was my soul with wonderous avarice,\\
to the muses we did not give leisure.\\
In that country I was not alone,\\
Oh, my splendid woman-friend and lover!\\
%------------------------------------------------
Underneath my hand, which was not at full strength,\\
you forgave the unfull sound of the lyre,\\
you, whose languid name inside of me,\\
like the moon, draws waves upon the shoreline.\\!

\poemtitle{In a Breeze}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{ In a breeze it does not always burn brighter}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
In a breeze it does not always burn brighter,\\
oh my friend, sometimes a torch is extinguished.\\
Waves do not always make easier sailing\\
more than calm waters.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Heedless young man, you hurry bliss unduly,\\
in scolding your maid for her languid passion --\\
have you forgotten that many like lightning \\
less than slow burning?\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Not to him is given the wondrous singing\\
of the lyre, whose hand plucks the strings insanely -- \\
many rules are in the (here is one -- remember!)\\
amorous science:\\!
%------------------------------------------------
as your long kiss creeps down from her smooth shoulders,\\
do not hasten there, where in drowsy languor,\\
two white turtle doves, two beloved marvels\\
sweetly respire.\\!

\poemtitle{Life is a Woman}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Life is a woman. Merely by her own seductions}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
Life is a woman. Merely by her own seductions\\
intoxicated, she will stand above her victim\\
The more unhappy is the soul that lies before her,\\
the fuller she all is with unrestrained desire.\\
How often her mysterious gaze has hovered over\\
my soul with powerful inquisitiveness,\\
but merely had my soul to quiver in responding-- \\
and silently, with unconcern, she sought the distance.\\!

\poemtitle{Leave me Here}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Leave me here as soon as possible! Oh, faster!}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
Leave me here as soon as possible! Oh, faster!\\
I'm smothering; I'm growing dull;\\
I'm becoming malicious and nasty;\\
I now shun everyone... \\
I don't feel at all engaged with other people.\\
Their happiness gives me no joy... \\
I despise all people... \\
Animals are a hundred times dearer to me.\\!

\poemtitle{Hardly Flesh}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{predict I'll suffer from my body }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Not spirit yet, but hardly flesh,\\
I have no need of bread so often,\\
it seems my finger, were it pricked -- \\
would drip not blood, but drops of heaven.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
But there are times: I'll pour a glass\\
brimful of wine -- and it is wanting,\\
and salt my bread until it's white,\\
but to my lips it tasted unsalted.\\
%------------------------------------------------
And whispers in my torrid dreams\\
predict I'll suffer from my body,\\
the same as from a pregnant wife,\\
one oddity upon another.\\!
%------------------------------------------------
Oh, dark, dark, dark path,\\
why are you so dark and lengthy?\\
Oh, veil that opened but a bit,\\
and then just wound itself up tighter!\\!
%------------------------------------------------
To bear one's seld right up to God,\\
and fall back into night, like stone,\\
and wait, until a lazy flame\\
will penetrate you to the bone!\\

\poemtitle{Music}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{ It seems my finger, were it pricked. }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
A spider spun my dark-hinged icon\\
and all my prayers' words are dead,\\
and in a day becoming witless,\\
upon the pillow shall sink my head\\!
%------------------------------------------------
That's the way she'll come for me -- \\
not as music, not sweet fragrance, \\
not as a darkly winged demon, \\
not as inspired quietude -- \\!
%------------------------------------------------
instead, a dog will howl, or else a \\
motorcar will sound its horn and \\
a rat will slither in its hole,\\!
%------------------------------------------------
That's how she'll be! Not good, not evil,\\
that's the music which I've lived to,\\
that's the music to which I'll die\\!

\poemtitle{To Seluc-Rasnatowskaya}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Each par of her whole being powerfully,  }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
So strong, like death, seductively-superbly,\\
Each part of her whole being powerfully,\\
Lovingly enticed us all to her.\\
Unbounded passions of the southern girl\\
Came forth, it seemed, in all her singing,\\
Resplendent, hot, and powerful Delilah!\\
Acknowledging the celebration's start,\\
She slithered, like a snake, around her prey...\\
Not feeling love, she unrestrainedly\\
And passionately gave herself; --for god,\\
That god whom all her patrimony's sons,\\
Oppressed slaves, adored and owed obeisance,\\
With zeal she tried enticing Samson into\\
Seductive snares, not feeling any love.\\
Kalypso-like, what power she put into her acting!\\
And with your furious and forceful passion,\\
You have infected certainly not Samson\\
Alone, it seems to me, Delilah!\\!

\poemtitle{In Pain}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{I'm in pain. I lack the strength to speak... }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I'm in pain. I lack the strength to speak... \\
Perhaps I \textit{am} pathetic, perhaps I \textit{am} worthless... \\
I can't keep you from thinking that... \\
But judges! The accusation is false!\\!
%------------------------------------------------
But are the surges of my passions,\\
their profundity, known to you?\\
And do you have the ability to desire\\
something as strongly as I?\\!
%------------------------------------------------
No, no! Not I, it's you who are powerless!\\
And it is for the likes of you to judge me?!...\\!
%------------------------------------------------
And if I, \textit{pathetic creature} that I am,\\
could meld some patience with the force of my desire,\\
then I, \textit{pathetic creature} that I am,\\
would subdue the world entire.\\

\poemtitle{To Liza Danziger}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{ Twilight time autumnal, Greyish all around...}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
Twilight time autumnal, Greyish all around... \\
Sparse and thinning forest, river, naked ground.\\
Earth is hidden under a yellow covering,\\
Dusky like song, the ditty that I sing.\\
I don't feel like singing songs bright as day,\\
I don't feel like singing in general anyway... \\
Twilight time autumnal, Greyish all around,\\
That, my dearest friend, is how our life is bound.\\!

\poemtitle{Perhaps}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Perhaps because I wished to fall in love with being}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
Perhaps because I wished to fall in love with being\\
with so much obstinate avidity\\
I felt more vividly how bottomlessles\\
dispassion for it had come over me.\\
But what of now? Can I be captivated\\
by life in an enraptured rush I do not understand?\\
My soul luxuriates in boundless freedom,\\
as if inhaling life for the first time.\\!

\poemtitle{Listen}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Just listen, how amidst inspired dreaming    }
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
Just listen, how amidst inspired dreaming\\
the sould will suddenly lay bare its secret curves.\\
Let your thought illuminate them brightly\\
with creation's breath in an audacious surge.\\
You will see, then, how the endless distance\\
so easily and wondrously removes its haze,\\
and there upon a lofty pedestal of marble\\
the depth of worlds feels Beauty's silent gaze\\!

\poemtitle{Gilded Trees}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{In mournful luxury of trees that have been gilded}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
In mournful luxury of trees that have been gilded,\\
in tiredness of branches bent without a quiver\\
is Autumn's quietude. Deserted and so pale\\
the distance that has dimmed; and in the night the play\\
of stars is cold; and a discerning silence\\
stands guard, or so it seems, to see if some weak sobbing\\
will not break out, a last enfeebled groan\\
from fading foliage. The air, though, is made thick\\
with fog . . . and it appears that the exhausted garden\\
wants to sigh, but doesn't dare; and strangely blazes\\
among the tree-tops, colorlessly gold,\\
a single ruby leaf, as if with blood engorged.\\!

\poemtitle{I Know}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{I know profoundly well—you've shown me everything}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
I know profoundly well—you've shown me everything,\\
the breathing of the skies, and speech of mighty billows\\
and twinkling of the stars within the depths of air,\\
and lightning's vivid laugh in gloomy quietude\\
you've given me with you in brilliant consonance.\\!

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
Oh mistress Anguish! You, the muse of incantations,\\
make one bright moment show from all the recollections\\
of my superfluous, unhappy , boring days!\\
And that unbounded moment , when, as in a graveyard,\\
the soul by the deserted silence is bewitched,\\
and cemetery visitors, the pangs of conscience,\\
will dig the past up from the bottom of all graves—\\
may you and I be reconciled in that moment,\\
and may the aimless lot I've drawn be bound with life,\\
as rainbows brightly unify the earth\\
with the heavens' inextinguishable blue.\\!

\poemtitle{In Words}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{In words, in their cold interlacing,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
In words, in their cold interlacing,\\
your movements' melody and pacing\\
how can I say?\\
Your raptures' whims, your passion's slumber,\\
your power, and the way you tremble\\
can I convey?\\
The misty North has not made cooler\\
your mouth's vermilion, or your golden,\\
deep suntan's stream;\\
the sun's warmth, live and animating,\\
flows on in you without abating,\\
my very dream.\\
All of the East's intoxications\\
I drink in the deep undulations\\
of your night eyes.\\
Your spicy smell, can I convey it?\\
My drunken heart, how shall I say it?\\
Oh love of mine! \\!

\poemtitle{Strangers}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Whose strange and savage will had cast a spell on us}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
Whose strange and savage will had cast a spell on us,\\
at that despondent, that night-time hour deep-— \\
was I tormenting fate, was I by fate tormented,\\
who came and stood your life in front of me?\\
Our hearts are still replete with our night's madness,\\
but there's a lifeless wrinkle by your mouth;\\
the needless words we speak are more abrupt and cruder,\\
an emptiness has frozen i n our eyes...\\
Oh ominous design! Paints that have been poisoned!\\
What has the artist of this canvas done \\
to paint two solitary, tragic masks like ours,\\
and merge two strangers' bodies into one?\\!

\settowidth{\versewidth}{At times our premonitions, at times our recollections}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
%------------------------------------------------
At times our premonitions, at times our recollections\\
uncover to our souls a world beyond our knowledge:\\
we like the features of the faces we have dreamed of,\\
the voices and the hues that make our hearts responsive;\\
and often all our lives, we yearn for them in secret.\\
We can't resist a thing that resonates their music;\\
we seek them in all things, the fleeting and eternal,\\
in pictures, poems, and in our beloved women...\\
Is that not why, my darling, you have me in your power?\\
What voice has made your voice become its repetition?\\
From whose curved lips have yours retained their obstinacy?\\
Whose arms encircle me when I'm in your embraces? \\!

\poemtitle{A Light Profound}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{A light profound, a light endearing,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

A light profound, a light endearing,\\
you passed along this soul of mine—\\
your ray plunged under fields to shine\\

And then I dreamed—of blossoming,\\
and bounteous harvests in my desert,\\
and in my heart, blue and calmly,\\
streamed morning from my years of spring.\\!

%------------------------------------------------
We hadn't noticed what the dusk was up to,—- \\
the muslin curtains suddenly looked grey,\\
the carpet deepened, the armchairs' outlines softened,\\
and you became—not you, and I became—not I.\\
A total stranger dropped her hand in sorrow\\
upon the place your hand had been till then,\\
and suddenly we knew our love was joyless,\\
and bloomed while hiding its own lack of strength.\\
Day's plashes had died down outside the windows\\
when oddly sharp, your voice began to speak\\
unnecessary words we both found strange;\\
when you got up, your shawl around your shoulders,\\
and rustling, your silks said their "so-long,"\\
when leaving, you gave me the merest nod\\!

%------------------------------------------------
You wrote your sister, "What a pity!\\
I forgot my sleeveless cloak."\\
Your fine script helps me track the features\\
of a soul I did not know.\\
You were incapable of trusting:\\
your o's and a's are tightly spaced.\\
I try in my imagination\\
to sketch the outlines of your face.\\
You were quiet, uningenious,\\
like your lines, formed modestly.\\
And everything my heart cherishes\\
you would malign as vanity.\\
I cling, though, to the tempting dream\\
that all the same, you would have loved me:\\
the flourish ending your delicate,\\
small "I" is just so lovely.\\!

"Like a small girl you appeared in my presence ungracefully"--\\
Ah, Sappho's single-line shaft pierced to my very core!\\

Embroidery has covered up\\
my windowpane. Oh day of parting!\\
I press my anguish-ridden hands\\
against the glass's unsmooth surface.\\
My devastated eyes look out\\
upon the frost, first gift of winter,\\
the way the icy moire melts down\\
and then dissolves away in teardrops.\\
The fence is buried in a drift,\\
the rime is fluffier, more like terry,\\
the garden under silver fringe\\
and tassels—like a brocade coffin...\\
No walkers and no cars are out,\\
my telephone is cruelly silent.\\
With letters on the sign GEORGES BLOK\\
I play at guessing odds or evens.\\!

You watched the little boys at all their games,\\
and showed indifference to smiling dolls.\\
A superfluity of energy propelled you\\
from your cradle straight astride a horse.\\
Years have passed, by their ominous shadow\\
your power-loving outbursts have not been\\
blotted out in your heart—how little I mean\\
to it, Bettina Arnim and Marina Mniszek!\\
I gaze upon the ash and fire of your curls,\\
upon your hands, more generous than a king's,\\
the lack of colors on my palette defeats me!\\

You are young, long-limbed! With such\\
a marvelously molded, winged body!\\
How awkwardly and with such difficulty\\
you drag around your spirit, anguish-stunned!\\
Oh, I know that spirit's way of moving\\
through whirlwinds of the night and ice-floe gaps,\\
and that voice that rises indistinctly,\\
God alone knows from what living depths.\\
I recall the darkness of bright eyes like those.\\
As when you read, all voices would grow quiet,\\
whenever she, a madman raving verses,\\
with her frenzy would ignite our souls.\\
How strange that you remind me so of her!\\
The same rosiness, goldenness,\\
and pearliness of face, and silkiness,\\
the same pulsating warmth.\\
And the coldness of serpentine wiles\\
and slipperiness... But I've forgiven her,\\
and I love you, and through you, Marina,\\
the vision of the woman who shares your name.\\!

Trudge on, trudge on, my placid gelding!\\
Your step is heavy, your step is measured,\\

If time could just evaporate this sweetness!\\
I've had enough. I do not want to want!...\\
Happy are those who in their youth can manage\\

Just in the gallery there one fool's still raving,\\
